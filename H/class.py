# decision tree
# algorithm to build a tree based on training data
# test data is classified by running it through the tree

# pro: easy to build and understand
# con: stiff model (hard decision boundaries), tends to over-fit, choose the appropriate number of splits!

# supervised learning means: we know the ground truth
